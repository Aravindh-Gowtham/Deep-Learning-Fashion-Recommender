Note: Image formats other than jpg or jpeg will not work

## Reproduce results locally
To quickly reproduce the results locally, clone the repo, install required libraries using requirements.txt and run test-run.py which will by
default take a men's T-Shirt image as input and show 5 similar T-Shirts. 

## Dataset
The data used for this application is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small

###### Side Note
As the images folder and image_features.pkl file exceeds Github limit of 100MB, I used git-lfs (https://git-lfs.github.com/) for these files.
